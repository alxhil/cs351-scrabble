-- Scrabble V1.0
 - the "b" scrabble is the blank tile
 - the 0x on the board is the starting location
 - I made all of the board by myself and I did not use any pictures, including the scrabble tile.
 
-- Things to watch out for
 - Try not to overlap a scrabble tile with another scrabble tile on the board, there is no system to detect it


-- Things that Haven't been added yet
 - Enemy player
 - Correctly placing scrabbles onto board *[Done]*
 - Dictionary lookup
 
 
-- Bugs
 - *[Fixed]* If you place the scrabble onto a tile a little northeast of the grid then it goes to the tile that is northwest or north of where you want the tile to go
 - *[Fixed]* Sometimes you have to place a tile twice for it to register (Very rare)
 
-- Things I want to get to
 - Score system
 - Tidy up code
